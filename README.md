# NGINX Advanced Caching Course Materials
This repository contains all of the training materials from today's session. To view the presentation you can either:

The lab solutions cover the material for all of the configurations (including demos).

They are located in the **conf_examples** folder. There are also other configurations examples that you may find useful, as well as a shell script that will rotate your logs via a cron job.
